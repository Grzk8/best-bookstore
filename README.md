# BestBookStore
BestBookStore is a webside of online bookstore.

## Project Overview
It`s a Frontend of Full-stack online bookstore site.
It is an application that I have been developing for a long time. While learning new technologies and tools, I have been updating the application by adding new modules and functions.
The front-end was made using the Sass preprocessor, which was helpful in designing a responsive website, so it is available for both for smartphones and large screens. It includes separate navigation, one for smartphones and tablets, and  other for large screens. The website was made in React using hooks. It allows you to browse books by category, search by title and author, add and remove them from basket. The application includes form validation and fetch API, which is connected to a back-end created in the Node.js Express framework. It is connected to the MongoDB database hosted by the Mongoose library, which creates a connection between MongoDB and NodeJS. This allows you to download, update and add data to the database. The application includes an authentication module. The server generates a Token, which is stored in the browser's localStorage and then sent back with a request to the backend. It allows you to set up an account, log in, place an order, view previous orders, change your data.
